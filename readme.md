# JavaScript Full Stack

- Fundamental JS Programming
    - JS Requirements
        - Foundation of Modern Open JS Full Stack App development
        - Provides End-to-End support for Application development
            - Interactive Front-End with Browser
            - Server-Side Apps
    - Types
        - No explicit DataTypes
        - a Variable is declared using 'var' keyword
            - The 'var' provides a function scope for a variable
        - The Type is parsed by JS Parser which is already available in browser 
            - Parsed Types as 
                - number, string, boolean,  object, function 
            - Parsed Type to extract values from the right-hand-side expression    
        - Standard JS Objects
            - window
                - represents a currently loaded window
                - Eventing to manage the JS Execution in the Browser
            - document
                - Currently loaded HTML DOM in current window object
                - to extract the DOM elements using 'document' object, use the window.onload event
                - Used to extract a DOM element so that the data can be read/write frm and to it
                    - UI Elements
                        - input: for Accepting Data and Selecting data
                            - text, radio, check, button
                            - property system
``` html
<input type="text" value="3" id="txt1" name="txt" class="c">
```
                                - input: the HTML tag
                                - type: the type of UI that will be shown on browser
                                - value: the data that can be entered in textbox and can be read from textbox
                                - id: the Unique identity of UI element in DOM
                                - name: the identity ti post the data to server using HTML Form 
                                - class: used to apply CSS Styes on HTML element, alternatively used to define a element group  
                    - The 'document' object's methods to extract UI element from DOM
                        - getElementById('id'); return an instance of single HTML element
                        - getElementsByTagName('TAG-NAME'), returns collection of HTML elements having name property value
                            - e.g. 
                                - document.getElementsByTagName('input'), return collection of input elements
                        - getElementsByClass('class-name'), returns collection of HTML elements having same class name property value        
                        - addEventListener(p1,p2,p3);
                            - USed to attach an event with UI element
                            - p1: the event name, e.g. click, change, blur, mouseenter, mouseleave, keyup, etc.
                            - p2: the function that will be executed when an event is raised
                            - p3: the boolean value to keep the event attached with UI element                      
            - Array (Not Directly accessible, but available as type)
                - The only Standard Collection Data Structure in JS
            - Number, String, Boolean, Date (Not Directly accessible, but available as type) 
            - console
                - Represents the out object to present the data to End-User
                    - console.log()   
                    - console.error()                 
    - Functions
    - DOM Interaction with JS
        - input elements    
            - Text
            - Button
        - collection elements
            - Provides a group of same UI
            - generated statically using HTML elements and its parent child relationship
            - generated dynamically using loops provided using JavaScript Programming
                - for..loop
                - for..in loop
                    - simplification of for..loop   
    - The JS 'Array'
        - The most powerful collection data structure in JS
        - In JS, this is an  'Array' class aka Type, which has following basic JS Methods
            - push(), pop(), data management methods
            - sort(), the data re-arrange methods
            - shift(), unshift() methods, to remove and add data in top of the array (at indexes from 0)
            - indexof(), read an element's existance in array
            - lastIndexOf(), the index of element from top to bottom but the last appearance of element
    - The JS literal objects aka JSON Object
        - a Key:Value pair that holds the Text-Based Data
        - The 'key' is literal identification and value can be 
            - primptive datatype e.g. number, string, date, object, array
            - a Function
            - var obj = {
                key:value
            };           
        - The literal object is global for the current JS function /  file as a Singleton Object   
        - within the object, literal (or keys) are accessed using 'this' object
        - The JS Provides an  'Object' class with following important methods
            - Object.keys(literal-object)
                - Used to read all keys of literal object
            - Object.values(literal-object)
                - Used to read value of each key in object
